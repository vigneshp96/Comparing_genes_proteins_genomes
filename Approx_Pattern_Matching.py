#  We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches if
#  there is some k-mer substring Pattern' of Text having d or fewer mismatches with Pattern;
#  that is, HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern') ≤ d. Our observation that a DnaA box may appear
#  with slight variations leads to the following generalization of the Pattern Matching Problem.

# Approximate Pattern Matching Problem:  Find all approximate occurrences of a pattern in a string.
# Input: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d.
# Output: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches.

#  Sample Input:
#  ATTCTGGA
#  CGCCCGAATCCAGAACGCATTCCCATATTTCGGGACCACTGGCCTCCACGGTACGGACGTCAATCAAAT
#  3
# Sample Output:
# 6 7 26 27

            if i1 != i2:

        if diff <= d:
            positions += [i]
    return positions
